# fightingtheboss.com (2015)

This is the built code for my personal site at [fightingtheboss.com](https://fightingtheboss.com), last published in April 2015.

This was originally a Middleman site, but I've somehow lost the original code and repo, so all that's left is the code from the server. I've decided to put it in a repo for posterity, as it's high time I made a new site, for fun and education.

This is all the content from the AWS S3 bucket, unredacted, from which this site is served.

## Dependencies

From looking through the code, this site depends on:

- jQuery (from Google's CDN)
- Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit)
- Google Analytics
